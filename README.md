# Overview

The code in this repository implements a MN-driven neuromuscular model with motor unit resolution, coupled with subject-specific musculoskeletal anatomy, and driven by individual MN spike trains infered from decomposed HDEMG signals.
The code is associated with the following publication:

# Instructions

1. Set up an environment
2. To run the MN-driven model, run 'MN-driven_model.py'
3. To plot and display the results obtained with the five experimental datasets, already stored in the Results folder, 
run 'Display_results.py'
